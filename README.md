# Code replay

### What is code replay?
I created code replay because I couldn't find an easy solution to do coding demos without having to code live.  
The idea was to "record" every step before the demo starts and just click through it when you present it.

### How to use?
- Clone the repo  
- Install the dependencies (`npm install`)
- Start the script (`node index.js`)

The script will guide you through the whole process.  
Every "step" is equivalent to a slide in a common presentation.

### ❗ INFO
Right now the software can only record but not "play" your changes.  
"Play"-Feature is coming very soon!

### ⚠️ EARLY STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT
The project is still in an early stage of development so it's not optimized or improved.
